Description: The RNAseqCovarImpute package imputes missing values of covariates using the following procedure: 1) Randomly bin genes into smaller groups. 2) Perform multiple imputation using the first bin of genes plus all other covariates in the predictor matrix to create N imputed datasets. 3) Perform differential gene expression analysis using the limma-voom pipeline on only the genes in this particular bin. The analysis is run on all N imputed data sets separately. 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all other gene bins. 5) Pool results with Rubinsâ€™ rules to produce combined coefficients, combined standard errors, and P-values. Adjust P-values for false discovery rate.
